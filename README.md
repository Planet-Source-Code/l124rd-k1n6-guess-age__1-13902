### Description

Hi!, this is my first program that i add, i hope to post more and more till my fingers get tired of being programming.

This is just a game, alike Magic numbers, the diference is that this program GUESS YOUR AGE!!! You just click on the columns where your age appears and the program tells you how old you are.

Hope you like it! and your comments!

Happy lines!
